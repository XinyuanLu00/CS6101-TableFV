Call the values in the third row x2 and y2.\nRate of change = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}\n = \\frac{8 - 4}{12 - 10}\n = \\frac{4}{2}\n = 2\nThe two rates of change are the same.\nIf you checked the rate of change between rows 2 and 3, you would find that it is also 2.\nThis means the rate of change is the same for each pair of points.

Call the values in the second row x2 and y2.\nRate of change = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}\n = \\frac{10 - 1}{15 - 14}\n = \\frac{9}{1}\n = 9\nNow pick any other two rows and calculate the rate of change between them.\nCall the values in the second row x1 and y1. Call the values in the third row x2 and y2.\nRate of change = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}\n = \\frac{19 - 10}{16 - 15}\n = \\frac{9}{1}\n = 9\nThe two rates of change are the same.\nIf you checked the rate of change between rows 1 and 3, you would find that it is also 9.\nThis means the rate of change is the same for each pair of points.

The bottom of the mine has a negative elevation, so it is below sea level.\nTo find the location closer to sea level, use absolute value. Absolute value tells you how far each location is from sea level.\nTop of the skyscraper: |275| = 275\nBottom of the mine: |-260| = 260\nThe top of the skyscraper is 275 meters above sea level, but the bottom of the mine is only260 meters below sea level.
