Each bike is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.\nThe event is A and B, \"the bike is red and has mountain bike tires\".\nSince this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.\n\nFind the number of outcomes in the event A and B.\nA and B is the event \"the bike is red and has mountain bike tires\", so look at the table to see how many bikes are a red and have mountain bike tires.\nThe number of bikes that are a red and have mountain bike tires is 7.\n\nFind the total number of outcomes.\nAdd all the numbers in the table to find the total number of bikes.\n4 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 19\n\nFind P(A and B).\nSince all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.\nP(A and B) = \\frac{# of outcomes in A and B}{total # of outcomes}\n = \\frac{7}{19}\nThe probability that a bike is red and has mountain bike tires is \\frac{7}{19}."
